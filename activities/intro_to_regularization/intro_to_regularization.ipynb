That is, we do not bring more parameters to bear than we have the ability to constrain.  We constrain them observations as we have seen so far, but we also know things about the system that are not hard data like measurements.  This \"soft-knowledge\" can also be applied to  constrain our parameters through a mechanism called __\"Tikhonov regularization\"__.  In this formulation of the inverse problem, we add a second term to our \"best fit\" metric Phi. This second term reflects the deviation from our soft-knowledge of the system, and is a penalty to our fit. Here's how it looks using the Anderson et al. (2015) forumlation:\n",

These 2 terms combine to create a __total Phi__ on the left.  __Now Total Phi is what we minimize__, which means we are minimizing our observed-to-simulated residuals __AND__ the deviation from soft-knowledge.  So in this way Tikhonov regularization is a \"dual-constrained minimization\".  "

    "What happened?  We replace the preferred value equations with a bunch of new equations.  These equations each include two parameter names and have different weights - can you guess what the weights are?  The weights are the pearson correlation coefficients (CC) between the pilot points (remember those from way back?).  These CC values are calculated from the covariance matrix, which is implied by the geostatistical structure...whew! For example, ``hk00`` is \"close\" to ``hk01``, so they have a high CC value (equation 1).  Just for fun, go back and change the \"a\" parameter in the variogram and see how it changes the CC values..."

    "### Singular Value Decomposition can be thought of as operating in a similar fashion but is automated, and more clever.  Using the Jacobian matrix, it reduces the number of base parameters by making linear combinations of the base parameters.  Thus two perfectly correlated parameters become 1 combined parameter, which helps give a unique solution to the parameter estimation problem. Those linear combinations (__=singular values__) that are in the noise (__=null space__) get truncated (__=removed from the parameter estimation process__).  This means that insensitive parameters don't adversely affect the parameter estimation process.  Those linear combinations that remain (__=solution space__) are then used to solve the parameters estimation problem.  \n",

    "### Truncated SVD approach makes for a parameter estimation process that is __*unconditionally stable*__, which means it is guaranteed to be well-posed, and solvable. But the number of singular values also controls, in a somewhat brute force way, the degree of parameter smoothing and fit. The key to stability and degree of smoothing is this truncation process, which we'll dig into here.\n"
